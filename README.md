# Linux-Scripts
A repository of the scrips and configs I use on my Linux machines. Some files may have some generic information in all caps, this is to sensor sensitive infomration (such as ip address, usernames, passwords, etc.) from the file. The all cap information will take the form of: NAME, IP ADDRESS, USERNAME, etc.<br><br>
